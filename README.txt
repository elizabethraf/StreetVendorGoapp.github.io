About Us

StreetVendorGo is a mobile application that helps street vendors to maintain their clients and expand their reach beyond their physical location.

Street vendors face many challenges, including limited access to customers, unpredictable demand, and the inability to sell during lockdowns. During the COVID-19 pandemic, street vendors were hit hard as they were not able to go out and sell, causing them financial strain. StreetVendorGo aims to solve these challenges by providing an online platform where street vendors can connect with customers and expand their business.Target Audience: StreetVendorGo is targeted at street vendors who are looking to expand their reach beyond their physical location. The app is also designed for customers who want to buy products from street vendors without having to visit them in person.
